# Github Pages

## Story

Making a website to show it only on your laptop is no fun.
To serve your content, you will need a server. 

Luckily, you won’t always need a whole computer to act as a server, 
but there are many different ways to share your page. 
Like when you have a static site - which consists only of HTML, CSS and JS (and image) files - 
there are many options for hosting. One of the most commonly used one is GitHub Pages, 
GitHub’s own solution.

Let’s clone a test project, and share it with the world!

## What are you going to learn?

- How easy it is to use an online service for hosting
- A way to publish a static website

## Tasks

1. Clone the repository under a `projects` folder on your computer (which can be anywhere in your user's home space)!
    - The repository is cloned into `projects/github-pages-general-GITHUBUSERNAME`.

2. Replace the `replace this` text in the repository
    - The `replace this` text is replaced with a personal sentence.
    - The new text is inside a `<p>` tag.
    - The change is commited in git.
    - The commit message is meaningful.
    - There is no typo in the commit message.

3. Follow the official tutorial for a "Project site", and share your project with the world.
    - The modified webpage is available at https://codecoolglobal.github.io/github-pages-general-GITHUBUSERNAME

## General requirements

- You need to have Git installed (check `git --version` on your system), otherwise visit [this page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Hints

- Documentation is the developers best friend.
- GitHub Pages are available for public, or payed private accounts.
  `CodecoolGlobal` is a paid organization account, so you can accomplish this project.
  If you'd like to use GitHub Pages on your personal repository, it has to be set to publicly available, 
  or you'll need to upgrade your personal account.
